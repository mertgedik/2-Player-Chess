# 2-Player-Chess

To play the game open Chess.py and execute it. 
The game was made for practicing Tkinter library in python. The structure of code is very complicated and is very difficult to read. Also, there is no entry page, information page, undo button, time etc. This is because it was my first project with Tkinter library and my main goal was coding chess game not visuals and graphics that much, so I did not do that much effort to imporve them. 
The gameplay is the same as classical chess. Both players are humans, so there is not any AI to play against you. You can play the game with your friend next to you.
